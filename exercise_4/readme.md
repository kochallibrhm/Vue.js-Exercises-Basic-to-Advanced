In that exercise, we are gonna use "computed" and "watch" properties. We are gonna see the diffrence between these two(the watch property only executes if value changes). And also we are gonna use setTimeout.

How it works?
There is two button adding 1 and 5 to value. And if value is 33, label is gonna change with "completed" instead of "not yet". Ä°f value change once it is gonna be reset after 5 seconds. And that 5 second time is changable with input element.
